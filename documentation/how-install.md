# Installation instructions

For start the modification, you need installed Forge, it is desirable that the version matches the supported versions. You can download Forge from the [link](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.14.4.html).
Move the downloaded mod to the `mods` folder (installation example below).

Also do not forget to install dependencies, only two types of dependencies: mandatory (game will not start without a mod) and recommended (without a mod, game can start, but I recommend using it)

Downloads: [Core](https://github.com/ProjectEssentials/ProjectEssentials-Core)

```none
.
├── assets
├── config
├── libraries
├── mods (that's how it should be)
│   ├── Project Essentials Core-MOD-1.14.4-1.X.X.X.jar (mandatory)
│   └── Project Essentials Backup-1.14.4-1.X.X.X.jar
└── ...
```

Now try to start the game, go to the `mods` tab, if this modification is displayed in the `mods` tab, then the mod has been successfully installed
